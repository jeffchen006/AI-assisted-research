# Checklist: Screening (title/abstract)

For each candidate paper:
- Is the task/problem within scope?
- Does the paper’s setting match (population/data/domain)?
- Is it the right type (conference paper vs workshop vs blog)?
- Does it fall within the timeframe?
- Is venue in your allowlist (if required)?

Decision rules
- Include: clearly in-scope and meets criteria
- Exclude: clearly out-of-scope or violates criteria
- Maybe: unclear; requires full text
