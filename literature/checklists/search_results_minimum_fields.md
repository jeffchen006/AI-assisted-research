# Checklist: Search results minimum fields

For each paper record, ensure:
- Title (non-empty)
- Authors (at least one if available)
- Publication year
- Venue/conference name
- Landing URL (publisher/arXiv/Semantic Scholar)
- PDF URL if available

If any are missing, mark them explicitly as missing (don’t guess).
