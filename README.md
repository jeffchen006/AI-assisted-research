This project never aims to replace human researchers in the research process. 

This project never aims to replace human reviewers in the review process. 





Some notes:



Meta point:

1. Be painfully specific

2. Tell it why you want it

3. Your examples are the truth

4. Work in small checkpoints

5. Agent: 
Good prompt - 

You are an agent in a multi-turn workflow. At teh end of each turn, summarize your progress and save the current state to a file named "state.json".

6. Control formatting by saying what to do

Output the final answer as a JSON object

7. Claude Opus 4.5 can over-trigger tools if your prompt screams "MUST". Use calmer guidance

It is certainly an iterative process. You should not expect it to be perfect at the first glance.
